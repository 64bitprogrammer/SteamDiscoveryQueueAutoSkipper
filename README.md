# Steam Discovery Queue Auto-Skipper
This userscript auto-clicks the "Next in Queue" button when it detects that you are viewing a Steam Discovery Queue item.

## Why?
During the [Steam Summer Sale](http://store.steampowered.com/salefaq/) you get trading cards for going through your queue up to three times a day.  
This script makes it easier to stay lazy.
